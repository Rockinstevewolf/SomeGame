# Simple platformer top view shooting game for two players for local network

## PACKAGES
	- "zmq" for making connectivity
	- "SFML" for making graphics

## If you could handle with packages
	- check some files or Makefile
	- at least you can exec ./server and ./game in different console apps
	- this project seems to be very unfinished
	- but it works for me
	- bye...
